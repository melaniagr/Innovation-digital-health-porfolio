## Applications

**Example applications**:

### Implementation Science for Psychiatric Innovations
**Problem**: Good research doesn't automatically translate to clinical practice  
**Solution**: Systematic implementation planning  
**Innovation thinking**: How do we overcome barriers to adoption? What organizational changes are needed?  

**Example**: If you develop a psychiatric AI tool, how would you:
- Train clinicians to use it effectively?
- Integrate it into workflow?
- Measure implementation success?
- Scale to other settings?

---

## Models

### 1. Innovation-to-Implementation Pathway
```
Innovation (What's the problem?)
    ↓
Design (How do we solve it?)
    ↓
Validation (Does it work?)
    ↓
HTA (Is it cost-effective?)
    ↓
Adoption (Will clinicians use it?)
    ↓
Scaling (Can it work elsewhere?)
    ↓
Sustainment (Does it stick?)
```

### 2. Digital Ecosystem
- **Patients**: Using apps, wearables, telepsychiatry
- **Clinicians**: Receiving data, supporting digital tools, integrating into care
- **Researchers**: Building and validating tools
- **Regulators**: Setting standards (CE marking, FDA)
- **Tech companies**: Developing and commercializing
- **Payers**: Assessing cost-effectiveness

### 3. ML in Psychiatry: Beyond Accuracy
```
Accuracy (Does it predict?) ← Basic requirement
    ↓
Fairness (Works equally across demographics?)
    ↓
Interpretability (Can clinicians understand why?)
    ↓
Calibration (Are confidence levels accurate?)
    ↓
Regulatory compliance (Will regulators approve?)
    ↓
Clinical utility (Will clinicians actually use it?)
    ↓
Patient acceptability (Will patients trust it?)
```

### 4. Patient-Centered Innovation
**Spectrum of involvement**:
- Inform: Share information one-way
- Consult: Ask for feedback
- Collaborate: Partner in design/research
- Co-produce: Patients are co-designers/co-researchers

**Why it matters**: Co-produced innovations are more likely to be adopted because they actually solve problems patients care about.

## Sample Project: Designing a Digital Intervention

**Using frameworks from this portfolio**, here's how you'd approach designing a depression app:

1. **Innovation Phase** (Healthcare Innovation course)
   - Problem: Depression is undertreated; long waitlists for therapy
   - Innovation: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app
   - Identify barriers: Cost, accessibility, engagement, stigma

2. **Design Phase** (Digital Health: Design & Implementation)
   - User-centered design: Interview patients and clinicians
   - Prototype: Create mockups, test with users
   - Design for diverse populations: Ensure accessibility for different demographics

3. **Validation Phase** (Research Training + Machine Learning)
   - RCT comparing app to waitlist control
   - Use ML to predict who will engage with app
   - Assess fairness: Does app work equally for all demographics?

4. **Evaluation Phase** (AI Evaluation + HTA)
   - Clinical validation: Does it actually reduce depression symptoms?
   - Implementation evaluation: Did clinicians recommend it? Did patients use it?
   - HTA: Is it cost-effective compared to usual care?

5. **Adoption Phase** (Implementation Science + Public Involvement)
   - Patient advisory group feedback
   - Clinician training and integration into workflow
   - Address adoption barriers (workflow fit, EHR integration, reimbursement)

6. **Scaling Phase** (Project Management + Innovation)
   - Plan how to scale to other healthcare systems
   - Assess sustainability: Will organizations continue using it?
   - Document lessons learned
